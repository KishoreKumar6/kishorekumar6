# kishorekumar 
### Hi, I’m Kishore Kumar — a Full Stack Developer with a passion for crafting scalable and responsive web applications.

I specialize in building seamless user experiences using modern front-end technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js, and also excel in back-end development with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. From designing interactive interfaces to engineering robust APIs, I bring a modular, efficient mindset to every project I build.

🏢 Perisync Technology – Frontend Developer (Aug 2025 – Present)
🔧 Key Responsibilities
Developed reusable UI components using React.js, TailwindCSS, and Shadcn UI, ensuring scalability and consistency across applications.

Integrated REST APIs into dashboards and user-facing modules, enabling smooth data flow and real-time updates.

Collaborated with designers and backend developers to deliver responsive, modern, and user-friendly interfaces.

Applied state management techniques (React hooks, Context API) to maintain application performance and reliability.

Conducted debugging and optimization using Chrome DevTools, React Developer Tools, and ESLint to improve efficiency.

I’ve completed hands-on training with GUVI Learning Institute (Nov 2024 – May 2025), where I worked on projects like an e-commerce platform with secure user authentication, and have explored JWT, and API testing with Postman. Whether it’s developing custom data structures or diving deep into DSA topics for technical interviews, I embrace progressively challenging tasks that enhance both functionality and performance.
